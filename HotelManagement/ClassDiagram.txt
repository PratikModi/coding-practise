         another will be a receptionist. Housekeeping will keep track of the housekeeping records of a room, and a Server will handle room service.
RoomBooking: This class will be responsible for managing bookings for a room.
Notification: Will take care of sending notifications to guests.
RoomHouseKeeping: To keep track of all housekeeping records for rooms.
RoomCharge: Encapsulates the details about different types of room services that guests have requested.
