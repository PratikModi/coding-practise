/**
 * Longest Subarray With Equal Number of 0s and 1s
 * Given an array arr[] containing only 0s and 1s, find the longest subarray which contains equal no of 0s and 1s.
 *
 * Examples:
 *
 * Input: arr[] = [1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]
 * Output: 6
 * Explanation: arr[1 ... 6] is the longest subarray with three 0s and three 1s.
 *
 * Input: arr[] = [0, 0, 1, 1, 0]
 * Output: 4
 * Explanation: arr[0 ... 3] or  arr[1 ... 4] is the longest subarray with two 0s and two 1s.
 *
 * Input: arr[] = [0]
 * Output: 0
 * Explanation: There is no subarray with an equal number of 0s and 1s.
 *
 * ðŸ’¡ Intuition
 *
 * We want equal number of 0s and 1s.
 * â†’ Replace all 0s with -1.
 * Now the problem becomes:
 * Find the longest subarray with sum = 0.
 * Because:
 * 	â€¢	1 â†’ +1
 * 	â€¢	0 â†’ -1
 * 	â€¢	Equal numbers of 1s and -1s â†’ sum = 0
 *
 * âœ… Approach (Prefix Sum + HashMap)
 * 	1.	Initialize a sum = 0 and maxLen = 0.
 * 	2.	Use a HashMap to store the first index where a particular prefix sum occurs.
 * 	â€¢	Key = prefix sum
 * 	â€¢	Value = index
 * 	3.	Iterate through the array:
 * 	â€¢	Replace 0 with -1.
 * 	â€¢	Add to prefix sum.
 * 	â€¢	If sum = 0 â†’ subarray from 0 to i is balanced.
 * 	â€¢	If the same sum was seen before â†’ subarray between the two indices is balanced.
 * 	â€¢	Update maxLen accordingly.
 *
 * ðŸ§  Complexity
 * Type         Complexity        Reason
 * Time             O(n)             Single pass through array
 * Space           O(n)             HashMap stores prefix sums
