/**
 * 305. Number of Islands II
 * You are given an empty 2D binary grid grid of size m x n. The grid represents a map where 0's represent water and 1's represent land.
 * Initially, all the cells of grid are water cells (i.e., all the cells are 0's).
 *
 * We may perform an add land operation which turns the water at position into a land.
 * You are given an array positions where positions[i] = [ri, ci] is the position (ri, ci) at which we should operate the ith operation.
 *
 * Return an array of integers answer where answer[i] is the number of islands after turning the cell (ri, ci) into a land.
 *
 * An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically.
 * You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 *
 * Input: m = 3, n = 3, positions = [[0,0],[0,1],[1,2],[2,1]]
 * Output: [1,1,2,3]
 * Explanation:
 * Initially, the 2d grid is filled with water.
 * - Operation #1: addLand(0, 0) turns the water at grid[0][0] into a land. We have 1 island.
 * - Operation #2: addLand(0, 1) turns the water at grid[0][1] into a land. We still have 1 island.
 * - Operation #3: addLand(1, 2) turns the water at grid[1][2] into a land. We have 2 islands.
 * - Operation #4: addLand(2, 1) turns the water at grid[2][1] into a land. We have 3 islands.
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: m = 1, n = 1, positions = [[0,0]]
 * Output: [1]
 *
 * So we can‚Äôt re-run DFS/BFS each time (that‚Äôd be O(m√ón√ók) = too slow).
 * Instead, we use a Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union) structure to efficiently merge connected land cells and count islands dynamically.
 * ‚úÖ Approach (Union-Find / DSU)
 * üí° Core Idea
 *
 * Treat each cell (r, c) as a node (index = r * n + c)
 * Initially all cells are water (-1) (not in DSU)
 * When a land cell is added:
 * Set its parent to itself ‚Üí new island (+1)
 * Check its 4 neighbors (up, down, left, right)
 * If a neighbor is also land ‚Üí union them (if they‚Äôre in different sets ‚Üí one island merges, count -1)
 * Keep track of the running island count.
 *
 * ‚öôÔ∏è Complexity Analysis
 * Type	Complexity	Explanation
 * Time	O(k √ó Œ±(n√óm))	Œ± is inverse Ackermann (practically constant)
 * Space	O(m√ón)	For parent & rank arrays
