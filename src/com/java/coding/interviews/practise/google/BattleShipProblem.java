/**
 * 419. Battleships in a Board
 * Given an m x n matrix board where each cell is a battleship 'X' or empty '.', return the number of the battleships on board.
 *
 * Battleships can only be placed horizontally or vertically on board. In other words,
 * they can only be made of the shape 1 x k (1 row, k columns) or k x 1 (k rows, 1 column),
 * where k can be of any size. At least one horizontal or vertical cell separates between two battleships
 * (i.e., there are no adjacent battleships).
 *
 * âœ… Optimal Solution (Mathematical / Counting Logic)
 *
 * We only need to count the starting cell of each battleship â€” i.e., the top-left-most cell of a ship.
 *
 * A cell (i,j) is the start of a new battleship if:
 * 	â€¢	Itâ€™s 'X', and
 * 	â€¢	There is no â€˜Xâ€™ above it (board[i-1][j] != 'X'), and
 * 	â€¢	There is no â€˜Xâ€™ to the left of it (board[i][j-1] != 'X').
 *
 * Input: board = [["X",".",".","X"],[".",".",".","X"],[".",".",".","X"]]
 * Output: 2
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: board = [["."]]
 * Output: 0
 *
 * ðŸ§® Complexity
 * Time
 * O(MÃ—N) â€” single pass
 * Space
 * O(1) â€” no extra memory
