/**
 * Write an algorithm to determine if a number n is happy.
 *
 * A happy number is a number defined by the following process:
 *
 * Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits.
 * Repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1.
 * Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy.
 * Return true if n is a happy number, and false if not.
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: n = 19
 * Output: true
 * Explanation:
 * 12 + 92 = 82
 * 82 + 22 = 68
 * 62 + 82 = 100
 * 12 + 02 + 02 = 1
 *
 * ðŸ”‘ Time Complexity
 * 	â€¢	Each step = O(log n)
 * 	â€¢	Steps = constant upper bound (â‰¤ 810, or even tighter â‰¤ 243 for 32-bit int).
 * 	â€¢	Total = O(log n)
 *
 * 	For a 32-bit integer, max is 2,147,483,647 (10 digits).
 * So max sum of squares = 9Â² Ã— 10 = 810.
 * 	â€¢	That means once you start, numbers quickly fall into the range 1â€“810.
 * 	â€¢	After that, youâ€™re just cycling or reaching 1.
 * 	â€¢	So there are at most O(810) â‰ˆ constant iterations before repeating or terminating.
