/**
 * 366. Find Leaves of Binary Tree
 * Given the root of a binary tree, collect a tree's nodes as if you were doing this:
 *
 * Collect all the leaf nodes.
 * Remove all the leaf nodes.
 * Repeat until the tree is empty.
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 *        1
 *        / \
 *       2   3
 *      / \
 *     4   5
 * Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5]
 * Output: [[4,5,3],[2],[1]]
 * Explanation:
 * [[3,5,4],[2],[1]] and [[3,4,5],[2],[1]] are also considered correct answers since per each level it does not matter the order on which elements are returned.
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: root = [1]
 * Output: [[1]]
 *
 * üí° Intuition
 *
 * Instead of actually deleting nodes layer by layer (which would be inefficient),
 * we can assign a ‚Äúheight‚Äù to each node, where:
 * height = distance from the node to its farthest leaf
 * Leaves have height 0.
 * Their parent will have height 1, and so on.
 * Then, we can group nodes by height ‚Äî all nodes with the same height will be removed together in one round.
 *
 * üß† Step-by-Step Approach
 * 	1.	Use DFS (post-order) to compute height of each node.
 * 	2.	Add each node‚Äôs value to a list corresponding to its height.
 * 	3.	Return the list of lists.
 *
 *üßÆ Time & Space Complexity
 * 	‚Ä¢	Time Complexity: O(N) ‚Äî each node visited once.
 * 	‚Ä¢	Space Complexity: O(N) ‚Äî for recursion + result list.
