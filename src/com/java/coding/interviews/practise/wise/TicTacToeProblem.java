/**
 * 348. Design Tic-Tac-Toe
 * Assume the following rules are for the tic-tac-toe game on an n x n board between two players:
 *
 * A move is guaranteed to be valid and is placed on an empty block.
 * Once a winning condition is reached, no more moves are allowed.
 * A player who succeeds in placing n of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.
 * Implement the TicTacToe class:
 *
 * TicTacToe(int n) Initializes the object the size of the board n.
 * int move(int row, int col, int player) Indicates that the player with id player plays at the cell (row, col) of the board.
 * The move is guaranteed to be a valid move, and the two players alternate in making moves. Return
 * 0 if there is no winner after the move,
 * 1 if player 1 is the winner after the move, or
 * 2 if player 2 is the winner after the move.
 *
 * ‚ùå Naive Approach (O(n¬≤))
 * Maintain a 2D board and after each move:
 * Mark board[row][col] = player
 * Check entire row, column, and diagonals for win.
 * Problem:
 * Every move() would take O(n) ‚Üí for n=1000, too slow (10‚Å∂ operations).
 *
 * ‚úÖ Optimized Approach (O(1))
 * Instead of scanning the entire board, we track counts per row, column, and diagonal for each player.
 * Idea:
 * Each cell contributes +1 if Player 1 plays, and ‚Äì1 if Player 2 plays.
 * If any row/col/diag has an absolute sum = n, that player wins.
 *
 * üß© Time and Space Complexity
 * Operation	Time	Space
 * move()	    O(1)	 O(n)
 *
 * üëâ The diagonal and anti-diagonal are special lines that cut across the square board:
 * Diagonal = top-left ‚Üí bottom-right
 * Anti-diagonal = top-right ‚Üí bottom-left
 *
 * üîπ 1Ô∏è‚É£ Main Diagonal
 * Cells that go from top-left to bottom-right:
 * (0,0), (1,1), (2,2)
 * üëâ Notice a pattern:
 * For all of them, row index == column index.
 *
 * if (row == col)
 *
 * üîπ 2Ô∏è‚É£ Anti-Diagonal
 * Cells that go from top-right to bottom-left:
 * (0,2), (1,1), (2,0)
 * üëâ The pattern here is different:
 * For each cell,
 * row + col = n - 1
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input
 * ["TicTacToe", "move", "move", "move", "move", "move", "move", "move"]
 * [[3], [0, 0, 1], [0, 2, 2], [2, 2, 1], [1, 1, 2], [2, 0, 1], [1, 0, 2], [2, 1, 1]]
 * Output
 * [null, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]
