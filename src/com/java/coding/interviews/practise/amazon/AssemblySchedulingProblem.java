/**
 * Assembly Line Scheduling | DP-34
 * Difficulty Level : Medium
 * Last Updated : 25 May, 2021
 * A car factory has two assembly lines, each with n stations. A station is denoted by Si,j where i is either 1 or 2 and
 * indicates the assembly line the station is on, and j indicates the number of the station. The time taken per station is denoted by ai,j.
 * Each station is dedicated to some sort of work like engine fitting, body fitting, painting, and so on.
 * So, a car chassis must pass through each of the n stations in order before exiting the factory.
 * The parallel stations of the two assembly lines perform the same task.
 * After it passes through station Si,j, it will continue to station Si,j+1 unless it decides to transfer to the other line.
 * Continuing on the same line incurs no extra cost, but transferring from line i at station j â€“ 1 to station j on the other line takes time ti,j.
 * Each assembly line takes an entry time ei and exit time xi which may be different for the two lines.
 * Give an algorithm for computing the minimum time it will take to build a car chassis.
 *
 * The below figure presents the problem in a clear picture:
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * The following information can be extracted from the problem statement to make it simpler:
 *
 * Two assembly lines, 1 and 2, each with stations from 1 to n.
 * A car chassis must pass through all stations from 1 to n in order(in any of the two assembly lines).
 * i.e. it cannot jump from station i to station j if they are not at one move distance.
 * The car chassis can move one station forward in the same line, or one station diagonally in the other line.
 * It incurs an extra cost ti, j to move to station j from line i. No cost is incurred for movement in same line.
 * The time taken in station j on line i is ai, j.
 * Si, j represents a station j on line i.
